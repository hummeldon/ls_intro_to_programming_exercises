# Hello
I will be using this repo as I work through the Launch School book called Intro to Programming. The goals of this are the following:
1. Learn and practice Ruby syntax and concepts.
2. Become more comfortable working with git and Github.
3. Practice creating code in a less "hand-holding" scenario.
